# 🐄 Cattle AI – Milk Yield & Health Prediction

*AI/ML-powered platform for dairy farmers to predict milk yield and detect cattle health issues early.*

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Dairy farming faces challenges due to fluctuating milk yield, which depends on **feed quality, activity, environment, and cattle health**.
A sudden drop in yield can indicate diseases like mastitis, nutritional imbalance, or stress — but farmers often rely on **manual observation**, leading to delays and financial losses.

**Challenge (Problem Statement 8):**
Build an **AI/ML-powered Cattle Monitoring Platform** that can:

1. Predict **daily milk yield** per cow based on multiple factors.
2. Detect **potential diseases early** by analyzing yield and health patterns.
3. Provide farmers with an **easy-to-use dashboard** for insights and preventive actions.

## 🌟 Our Solution

We developed **Smart Dairy AI**, a modern web platform that:

* 📊 **Predicts Milk Yield** – Uses regression-based ML models to forecast daily milk production per cow.
* 🩺 **Detects Diseases** – Classification model highlights risk of conditions like mastitis, digestive disorders, or mineral deficiencies.
* 🖥️ **Interactive Dashboard** – Farmers can input feed, activity, and health data to instantly view predictions and alerts.
* 📑 **Reports** – Generates downloadable reports (CSV/Excel/PDF) summarizing yield trends, feed utilization, and disease risks.

This ensures farmers can **optimize resources, act early on diseases, and maximize productivity.**
